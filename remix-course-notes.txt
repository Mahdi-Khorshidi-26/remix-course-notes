1- Explaning what remix is .
		how to create a remix project from ground up : npx create-remix@latest
		
2- Using the V1 default routing by first installing the npm package related to that : 
		npm i @remix-run/v1-route-convention
		then we need to go to vite.config.ts to change couple of files :
		first we should do the changes into defineConfige function :
		in the remix() function we need to add the following : 
		ignoredRouteFiles: ["**/.*"],
		routes(defineRoutes){
			return createRoutesFormFolders(defineRoutes);
		}
		also the defineConfige we can change the port that we want our 
		local server to be run on it so next to plugins:[] we can say :
		server:{
			port:3000
		}
		NOTE : the name of _index.tsx in the routes folder 
		should become index.tsx after changing the routing convention.
		if the tsconfing.ts file made some error in here just needs some 
		refreshing the window of the editor . 
		
3- Routing : what ever files names we define it becomes the route 
		for example in the routes folder we define a new component called: 
		Sales.tsx then /sales is the route defined for it .
		in the file there are some functions that can be defined to work around some customizition like 
		also it should not be forgotten that what ever named function component we " export default " it 
		it is the main Ui that is going to be shown then for the customizition we have some other 
		functions that they just need to be "export" like (these are reserved names): 
		1- export function loader() " Fetches and returns the data that the Sales component needs to display "
		2- export function action() " Handles form submissions "
		3- export function links()  " Defines <link> elements to add to the page when the user visits this route"
		4- export function meta()   " Returns metadata (e.g. page title ,description)
		5- export function ErrorBoundary() "React component that is displayed when an error accurs .
		6- export function headers()" HTTP headers to return with the page "
		7- export function handle() " Allows you to create custom application conventions
		8- export function shouldRevalidate() " Tool for additional optimization of data revalidation "
		also not to forget that we are writing the code in TS so each one of these has their own types 
		which I have defined next to the name of function where it should be . 
		NOTE : for e.g. loader and action go to SSR . ( more explnation later )
		
4- Navigation between pags : 
		for navigating between pages we can use <Link to="destination">somthing</Link> component
		also we have <NavLink to="destination">
						{(isActive)=>{return somthing}}
					</NavLink>		
					which in here we can install the clsx and use the isActive part in here for 
					classes to be passed condionaly.
		for creating nested routes for e.g. we have routes folder and in it we have Sales.tsx 
		then under that we want to have some other routes like /sales/app or /sales/settings
		we need to create a folder by sales name the exact same name of the component we want
		nested route under , then under that what ever components we define is the nested ones .
		also notice that in the parent component in the component tree we should define the 
		<Outlet/> just to show where we want the nested routes to be shown . 
		
5- Matching routes : this is something like for e.g. when we are under /sales/app/settings
		the matching routes are going to be [root.tsx,index.tsx,sales.tsx,app.tsx,settings.tsx]
		which this can help us to be aware of the tree component and how to access data 
		from the tree . 
		more explnation for later but just to be clear about the remix root.tsx 
		is like that the App component is getting passed as a childeren to Layout component
		and this Layout is only going to work in the root.tsx file not anywhere else .
		so if we want any thing to be there for all the components we can put it in 
		App component in root.tsx file next to <Outlet/>.
		
6- There are some espiciall components getting called in the Layout component in the 
		root.tsx file :
		
		1- <ScrollRestoration /> :(like emulation of default web behavouirs)
			this is speciall component that helps us to have the scroll to be back 
			where ever we have left it there in the previous page we were in .
			
		2- <Meta/> : which renders the meta links returned by the component export function meta():MetaFunction{}
		in each route or main component the example for it can be like :
		export const meta: MetaFunction = () => {
				return [
						{ title: "Recipe App" },
						{ name: "description", content: "this is a food recipe app " },
					];
					};
					
		3- <Links/> : this is the html links not the <a/> acullty its about the links in html 
			that we use to for e.g. loading the styles in html or fonts or other things like that . 
			which a good example of it can be : 
			before going for explnation of this lets say how we can load and use our styles or the css 
			matter in the remix : 
			
			1- creating the files styles.css where ever we want then importing them like 
			@import 'filename.css' then passing the class names defined in the css files to the 
			needed tags 
			
			2- creating the css files and loading them with a links function like below :
			@import styles from 'fileaddress?url'
			"?url" in the import makes it a url so we can pass it to the href file in the links function:
				export function links:LinksFunction(){
					return [
					{rel:"stylesheet",href:styles},
					]
				}
			we should know that for each file we should import and write this boiler plate code so it's a bit 
			annoying . 
			
			3- creating the css modules and importing them and passing the classes to the files . 
			
			4- using tailwindcss which when you install the remix the tailwind is installed atumaticly .
			
			
7- For using Icons we can use heroicons and then copying the jsx straight from it and it is really good .	
			
			
			
8- What are loaders : first of all we should say that the defining process is like this : 
			export function loader():LoaderFunction{
				return {message:"hello world!"}
				}
			and the usage in the main component is like :
			//do not forget to import them ;
			const data = useLoaderData();
			console.log(data.message)
			
			then we should know that loading data in remix is a bit different from react.js or next.js
			which these are going to load the component firts and give you the option to show a pending state 
			until the data gets loaded . but in remix the data gets loaded before the component gets 
			loaded so first data then component so the handling part of the pending is a bit different
			but should be know that this has several advantages and the good things out way to the disadvantages 
			so for example we can load data in parallel and another thing is that we avoid waterfall loading .
			so it makes our app so faster than usuall .and another thing is that since loader function
			is SSR so we can directly talk to database or do the BE implematations there for e.g. later . 
			
			
9- How to pending Ui : 
			1- one way is that we can add the feature reloadDocumet to Link or NavLink component
			so this is a default behavouir of the browser that shows a spinner up where favicon 
			exist then user would see that there is something happening . 
			
			2- another way is that we can use useNavigation which gives us some status like this :
			const navigation = useNavigation()
			const isloading = navigation.status === "which this can be loading/idle/submitting "
			and also to make sure that we are in the right route we can add another condition to above to say :
			const isloading = navigation.state === 'loading' && navigation.location.pathname === to;
			which if we see the value for navigation.location.pathname is the compelete url and "to" is just the 
			name of the route or the dynamic route value so to make them equivalent we can use a new hook called 
			const path = useResolvedPath(to)
			so the second part of should be :  navigation.location.pathname === path.pathname;
			
			
10-Sharing data between Routes in component tree: 			
			in remix where ever we have a useLoaderData in a component tree we can have load and have and pass
			that data from a parent to a child / child  to parent 
			as long as it is in the component tree so we can use a hook from remix called : 
			const matches = useMatches()
			so the matches is an array of object filled with the component tree information like to say 
			{
				data : "from loaderData"
				handle: "explnation later"
				id: "is the route"
				params:{}
				pathname:"for example / "
			}
			so we can create a custom hook getting the id as parameter then passing us the data from the component
			needed in the component tree. 
			another thing about useLoaderData is that if we pass a type to it the error would be visible right away :
			const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()
			which the loader is the function we have defined earlier. 
			
			
11- Error Handling : for this part we can use the ErrorBoundary function we have talked about earlier :
			and what ever we show in here will get shown instead of default component also we can make it to show the 
			acuall error too like below : 
			export function ErrorBoundary(){
				const error = useRouteError() " this gets actuall the error for that route"
				// to avoid errors of types we can put this if
				
				if(error instanceof Error){
				return <div>{error.message}</div>
				}
				return <div>an unexpected error occurred</div>
			}
